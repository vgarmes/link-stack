- Frontend (`/client`): React, bootstraped with create-react-app
- Database: MongoDB

## Develop

> You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and

- run `yarn` to install dependencies
- run `yarn start` to start development environment

In order to start the frontend, run the same commands inside `/client`.
By default, the server will be listening on port `5000` and the client on port `3000`.

## Build

> You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
> [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) installed

- run `yarn` to install dependencies
- run `yarn build` to build app for production
- output is in `build` directory,
  [ready to be deployed](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/)
